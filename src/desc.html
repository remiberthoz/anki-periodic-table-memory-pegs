<b>Periodic table memory pegs</b> features flashcards for all 118 elements of the periodic table, to help you memorize and associate name, atomic number, position in the table, and symbol of elements.

Each element is associated with a picture, which is designed to remind you of the element's name, atomic number, and abbreviation.

The cards in the deck will question you with one of the following: Picture, Name, Symbol, Number, or Position. The other side of the card will display all remaining data. There is also an explanation of how to use the pictures as memory pegs.

<b>Disabling the <i>Position</i> cards:</b>

Learning the position of elements in the table is very challenging. Users may want to disable the cards asking which element is at a given position in the table. Open Anki and go in the Card Browser/Card Navigator. Then search for `card:"Card 5"`, select all 118 cards, and suspend them. `Card 5` is the type of all cards asking for the position of elements.
